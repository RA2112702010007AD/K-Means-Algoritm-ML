# K-Means-Algoritm-ML
The k-means algorithm is a popular clustering algorithm in machine learning. It is an iterative algorithm that aims to partition a given dataset into k distinct clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the k-means algorithm:

1. Choose the number of clusters, k, that you want to create.

2. Initialize k cluster centroids randomly or by selecting k random data points as the initial centroids.

3. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid based on the Euclidean distance between the data point and each centroid.

4. Recalculate the centroid of each cluster by taking the mean of all data points assigned to that cluster.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the centroids no longer change significantly or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

6. Once the algorithm converges, the final centroids represent the centers of the clusters, and each data point is assigned to one of the clusters based on the nearest centroid.

The k-means algorithm aims to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares, which measures the squared Euclidean distance between each data point and its assigned centroid. It is an unsupervised learning algorithm, meaning it does not require labeled data for training.

K-means has various applications, such as customer segmentation, image compression, anomaly detection, and document clustering. However, it has some limitations, such as sensitivity to the initial centroid positions and the need to specify the number of clusters in advance.
